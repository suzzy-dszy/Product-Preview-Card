## My process

### Built with🏗️

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS/SCSS
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned📝

- First time using SASS/SCSS after learning from an online [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs&t=398s). I learnt how to implement the SASS file structure, variables, nesting, functions, mixins as well as the `clamp()` function to make responsive font sizes.
- Researching online helped me solve alot of responsiveness issues i was facing, all hail stack overflow 💯.
  -Further improved my understanding of my base CSS knowledge especially CSS Grid & Flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - An excellent resource to make quick referrals, and the demo code provided helps me to better understand the code I write.
